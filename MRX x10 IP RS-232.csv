Sample Command Strings,,,,,

,,,,,
Notes:,,,,,
1. Successful serial commands return ';' after the action is completed.,,,,,
"2. When a recognized command cannot be executed ""!E<OriginalCommand>"" is returned. Ex: trigger control is set to Menu, and ""R1SET1;"" is sent on the serial port, then the system would return ""!ER1SET1<LF>"". Ex2: no tuner preset assigned for preset #03 and ""T1PSL03<LF>"" is sent then the system would return ""!ET1PSL03<LF>""",,,,,
"3. Out-of-range parameters return the message ""!R<OriginalCommand>"". Ex: 'Z1VOL+50;' would result in a response: '!RZ1VOL+50;'",,,,,
"4. Invalid commands return the message ""!I<OriginalCommand>"". Ex 'HELLO;' would result in a response '!IHELLO;'",,,,,
"5. Receiving a command for a zone when the zone is off (but the system is not in standby), returns the message ""!Z<OriginalMessage>"".",,,,,
"6. Ony a few commands are valid when the system is in standby 'IDM?', 'ZxPOWy', 'ZxPOW?'. All other commands are considered 'Invalid'.",,,,,
7. Maximum command length is 256 bytes including the terminator. Maximum response length is 258 bytes.,,,,,
8. Average command processing latency must be less than 30 ms.,,,,,
9. Individual commands have a maximum processing latency of 100 ms.,,,,,
10. Systems that communicate over RS232 should wait for at least 1 s for a response before retransmision,,,,,
"11. When Standby IP Control is disabled in setup menu (this saves energy), the unit can still be powered on serially but power-on command must be sent twice - wait for semicolon response before sending power-on command the second time (around 1s). To avoid having to send power-on command twice, enable Standby IP Control via SIPx command.",,,,,
"12. MRX x10 software v1.1.9 and later forces Z2 tuner input selection to use the same band as Main in the event that one zone is trying to use AM and the other zone is trying to use FM. The forced change is not reported therefore the following queries must be used to keep status up to date:

a) When main input changes, query tuner status (Z1TBS?).

b) When Z2 input changes, query tuner status (Z2TBS?).

c) When both zones are on and Main input changes, query Z2 input to see whether it also changed (Z2INP?).",,,,,
